# AirQualityInsight

Simulation project of a sensor system to monitor air quality, with data sent to a server for real-time analysis and visualization.

The system simulates a network of sensors, such as Raspberry Pi, capable of measuring air quality. These measurements will be sent to a server, which will analyze them and present the data in real-time on a dedicated dashboard.

The measured data includes: CO2, PM10 and PM2.5 (Particulate Matter)

-   CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)
-   It is an important indicator of indoor air quality.
-   Elevated levels can indicate poor ventilation.
-   Optimal values are below 1000 ppm.
-   PM10 consists of particles with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers.
-   PM2.5 consists of even finer particles, with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers.
    -   They mainly originate from traffic, heating, and industrial activities.

Other values that may be measured in the future:

-   NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide): primarily from vehicular traffic.
-   O3 (Ozone): formed through photochemical reactions.
-   CO (Carbon Monoxide): from incomplete combustion.
-   SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide): from industrial processes.
-   VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds): from solvents, paints, and building materials.
